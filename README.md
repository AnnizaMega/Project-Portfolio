##  Introduction

Hello, I‚Äôm **Anniza Rahmawati Mega S**, a **Business Intelligence Analyst** with a unique blend of **entrepreneurial and business development experience** alongside strong **analytical expertise**.

Before transitioning into the world of data, I was **co-owner of Anonymous Outdoor Gears (2017‚Äì2024)** and **Business Development at Yuefa Universal (2021‚Äì2023)**.  
This background has provided me with a deep understanding of **how businesses operate**, from supplier relationships and pricing strategies to market expansion and customer behavior.

Today, I leverage this rich, real-world business perspective to **turn raw data into actionable strategies**.  
My portfolio reflects this unique blend ‚Äî applying techniques like **ETL, regression, segmentation, and churn analysis** ‚Äî to solve problems that directly affect a company‚Äôs bottom line.

Proficient in **Python (pandas, scikit-learn), SQL, Tableau, and Power BI**, I am able to extract, transform, and visualize data, helping businesses make smarter decisions.

I‚Äôm excited to grow into roles such as **Business Intelligence Analyst or Business Analyst**, where I can combine my entrepreneurial mindset, industry experience, and technical skills to drive measurable business impact.  
I‚Äôm **open to relocation to Malaysia, Singapore, or Australia** for the right opportunity.
